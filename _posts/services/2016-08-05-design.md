title: Algorithm Design
description: Designing algorithms is what we have been doing for the last 15 years. We design and implement machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and trends, extract knowledge and support decisions within several commercial domains, from finance, healthcare, traffic, and sales forecasting. Solutions can be deployed on premise and in the cloud, for production environments with high industrial standards.
