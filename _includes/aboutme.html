      Hi! I am Francesco Gadaleta, PhD. computer engineer specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Machine Learning.
      As researcher in Computer Science at the University of Leuven I developed novel hypervisor-based approaches to computer security, some of which became core technology at VMWare.
      Download my <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/413219/1/phd+dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a>
    </p>
     <p>
      As member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Li√®ge, I have been searching for solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework, assembling networks and merging clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients in a pre-symptomatic fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was data scientist at the Gasthuisberg Research Hospital located in Leuven, Belgium - one of the largest research hospitals in Europe - and member of the Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis">NIPT</a>  research group.
</p>
<p>
      I have been part of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson delivering the most accurate predictive models for disease interceptions and drug recommendation. In addition I have adviced a number of big data technology and strategies that turned out to be essential to the organization on a global scale.
</p>
<p>I am currently Chief Data Officer at <a href="https://www.abe.ai">Abe.ai</a>, creating artificial intelligence solutions for personal finance.
</p>
<p>
      I am based in Belgium and during my spare time I enjoy reading books, designing software and running ultra marathons.
</p>
<p>
      Technologies I am excited about include <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Natural Language Processing</b>,
      <b>Advanced Computer Programming</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>.
</p>
<p>
      If you are interested in hiring me for speaking, writing, machine learning and artificial intelligence consulting, or other opportunities, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.
</p>
<p>
      Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as
</p>
<ul>
    <li> Neural Networks and Deep Learning </li>
    <li> Non-linear dynamics</li>
    <li> Penalised regression methods</li>
    <li> Bayesian statistics</li>
    <li> LASSO and variants</li>
    <li> and much more</li>
</ul>
<p>
      Languages I am fluent in comprise
    </p>
<ul>
       <li>C/C++, PHP, SQL, Perl, Lisp</li>
      <li> Python, R, Java</li>
      <li> and more</li>
</ul>
<p>
      and some computing infrastructure I use with regularity </p>
<ul>
      <li> Virtualization technology (Virtualbox, VMWare, Xen, Docker)</li>
      <li> Amazon Web Service (AWS)</li>
      <li> Spark/Hadoop</li>
</ul>
<p>
      In my spare time I do ultra marathons (trail) on the distances of 55 and 80 km.
</p>
