      I am researcher Francesco Gadaleta, PhD. 
Since my childhood computers and math have dominated my life. I have been involved in several projects that have shaped my career as research scientist in different domains.

      As researcher in Computer Science at the University of Leuven I developed novel hypervisor-based
      approaches to computer security, some of which became core technology at VMWare.

     <p>
      As member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Department of Electrical Engineering and
      Computer Science of the University of Li√®ge, I have been searching for solutions to integrate
      heterogeneous data (OMICS) within common analytics framework, assembling networks and merging clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients in a pre-symptomatic fashion.

    <p>
      I have been research data scientist at the Gasthuisberg Research Hospital located in Leuven,
      Belgium - one of the largest research hospitals in Europe - and member of the
      Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis">NIPT</a>
      research group.
    </p>

<p>
      I have been member of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson &amp Johnson where I designed and implemented the most accurate predictive models for disease interception and drug recommendation.  In addition, I have adviced a number of big data technologies and strategies that turned out to be essential to the organization on a global scale.

<p>I am currently Chief Scientist and Founder of <a href="http://www.fitchain.io">Fitchain</a>, the decentralized machine learning factory. I am also Senior Advisor at <a href="https://www.abe.ai">Abe.ai</a></p>

<h3> Other stuff </h3>
<p>
      I am currently based in Belgium, traveling extensively across Europe and USA.
      During my spare time I enjoy (a lot) reading books and (even more) long distance running and photography 
      When I feel inspired and get the time I enjoy photography. Here are my photo streams on <a href='https://www.flickr.com/people/135875565@N06/'> Flickr</a> and <a href='https://brutalityoftraveling.tumblr.com/'> Tumblr</a>
