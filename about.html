      Hi! I am Francesco Gadaleta, PhD. computer engineer specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Machine Learning.
      As researcher in Computer Science at the University of Leuven I developed novel hypervisor-based approaches to computer security, some of which became core technology at VMWare.
      Download my <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/413219/1/phd+dissertation.pdf">dissertation</a>
    </p>
     <p>
      As member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Li√®ge, I have been searching for solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework, assembling networks and merging clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients in a pre-symptomatic fashion.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been data scientist at the Gasthuisberg Research Hospital located in Leuven, Belgium - one of the largest
      research hospitals in Europe - and member of the Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis">NIPT</a>  research group.
    </p>

<p>
      I have been member of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson where I designed and implemented
      the most accurate predictive models for disease interception and drug recommendation.
      In addition, I have adviced a number of big data technologies and strategies that turned out to be essential
      to the organization on a global scale.
</p>

<p>I am currently Chief Data Officer at <a href="https://www.abe.ai">Abe.ai</a>, creating artificial intelligence
  solutions for personal finance.
</p>

<p>
      I am currently based in Belgium, traveling extensively across Europe and USA. During my spare time I enjoy
      reading books and running ultra marathons.
      Technologies I am excited about include <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>,
      <b>Natural Language Processing</b>, <b>Advanced Computer Programming</b> and <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>blockchains</b>,
      and <b>Operating System security</b>.
