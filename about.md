I am Francesco Gadaleta, PhD. computer engineer specialized in Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Machine Learning.
As researcher in Computer Science at the University of Leuven I developed novel hypervisor-based approaches to computer security, some of which became core technology at VMWare. Download my dissertation [here](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/413219/1/phd+dissertation.pdf).

As member of the Statistical Genetics Unit at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Li√®ge, I have been searching for solutions to integrate heterogeneous data (OMICS) within a common framework, assembling networks and merging clinical and genetic data together to make predictions about the risk of diseases for patients in a pre-symptomatic fashion.

I worked as data scientist at the Gasthuisberg Research Hospital (Belgium) in the Non-Invasive-Prenatal-Testing [NIPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_diagnosis) research group.

I have been part of the Advanced Analytics Team of Johnson&Johnson delivering the most accurate predictive models for disease interceptions and drug recommendation.

I am currently Chief Data Officer at <a href="https://www.abe.ai">Abe.ai</a>, creating intelligent solutions for personal finance.

I am based in Belgium and during my spare time I enjoy reading books, designing software and running ultra marathons.

Technologies I am excited about include **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, Advanced Computer Programming and Machine Learning.

If you are interested in hiring me for speaking, writing, machine learning and artificial intelligence consulting, or other opportunities, feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.

Academic background and on site experience provided me of the most powerful theoretical and practical tools for data analysis, such as

-  Neural Networks and Deep Learning
-  Non-linear dynamics,
-  Penalised regression methods,
-  Bayesian statistics,
-  LASSO and variants,
-  and much more

Languages I am fluent in comprise  
- C/C++, PHP, SQL, Perl, Lisp
- Python, R, Java

and some computing infrastructure I regularly use are
- Virtualization technology (Virtualbox, VMWare, Xen, Docker),
- Amazon Web Service (AWS),
- Spark/Hadoop,
- and designing of large information systems for the enterprise.

Last but not least I do ultra marathons on the distances of 55 and 80 km. The passion for running forces me to spend quite some time in the forest or on the road, where I enjoy to think while running. You can read some of my running adventures on [gipsyrunner](http://www.gipsyrunner.com).
